# GOIN' THE DISTANCE

Goin' the Distance is a python program that allows the user to make distance measurements based on two different equations.  It also allows you to convert latitude and longitude to radians, convert miles to meters and generate random coordiantes! This project was created for my Hackbright Prep Final Project.
